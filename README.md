# React Inspect Props [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-inspect-props.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucasconstantino/react-inspect-props)

> React properties inspector with the power of Redux DevTools

## Install

#### 1. Install [Redux DevTools](http://extension.remotedev.io/#installation) extension

#### 2. `yarn add react-inspect-props`

> Or, good ol' `npm install --save react-inspect-props`

## Usage

This lib provides a single Higher-Order Component called `inspectProps` with the following signature:

```js
inspectProps(
  name: string,
  options: Object | (props: Object) => Object
): HigherOrderComponent
```

This HoC will transparently connect your component to a new instance of the the Redux DevTools extension, identified by the name provided as first argument.

The second argument is optional. If provided, the object will be used when connecting to the extension. If a function is provided, it will be executed passing pros as the argument. Refer to the [documentation](http://extension.remotedev.io/docs/API/Arguments.html) of that method for more info.

### Simple as can

```js
import React from 'react'
import { compose, withState } from 'recompose'
import { inspectProps } from 'react-inspect-props'

const Counter = ({ count, setCount }) => (
  <div>
    <button onClick={ () => setCount(++count) }>
      Increment
    </button>
    <pre>{ count }</pre>
  </div>
)

export default compose(
  withState('count', 'setCount', 0),
  inspectProps('Counter inspector')
)(Counter)

```
